        <p><b>I have learned java for 1 years in Brooklyn College. I have done some projects as assignments on java class. So, I could understand and write basic java code. Python is my favorite programming language. I love to code with Python. I just learned turtle library in BMCC. It attracts me a lot. Then I learn python on Udemy by myself. I feel more comfortable in Python than java.
